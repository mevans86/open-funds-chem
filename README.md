## Fundamentals of Chemistry | Open Course
This course covers the fundamentals of chemistry, including simple models of matter, representations of chemical species and chemical changes, energy in a chemical context, and Lewis structures. The course places particular emphasis on using submicroscopic models and proportional reasoning. If you're an absolute beginner looking to learn more about the central science, start here!
